Dependencies:
_ FZlib libraries for Zlib stream support in flash 9 (http://www.wizhelp.com/fzlib/)

IDE:
_ Eclipse with Flex 3.0 Plugin with flash 10 support (need to download the last nightly build)

You can remove Flash 10 dependency by commenting some lines in Inflater.as

Yes, yes. I will write a better documentation later ... Ask me if you don't succeed to compile it ! (mfucci@gmail.com)
